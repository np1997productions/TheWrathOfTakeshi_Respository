We are proud to present The Wrath of Takeshi Digital Novella, a gripping RPG-inspired tale set in mystical Japan. Under the ruthless rule of Daimyo Takeshi, deadly storms strike fear into the land. As a martial artist, you must rise, mastering elemental powers, forging alliances, and uncovering ancient secrets to shape the destiny of a nation. Will you conquer Takeshi’s wrath, or be consumed by it?

This project marks a milestone for me, Nicholas Papadoulakis (NP1997Productions), as part of our continued journey in storytelling and interactive media. While this game still in production (ongoing) after its novella was released, our collaborative team project, Beyond the Horizon, developed by Team Berries, is still in production. Together, we are pushing creative boundaries and working toward something even greater before we start developing The Wrath of Takeshi.

A tale of honor, resilience, and redemption awaits, this is just the beginning.
